# 🔍 Decentralized Audit Tool for Regulatory Compliance

Welcome to a revolutionary decentralized platform that ensures tamper-proof auditing and compliance tracking for international drug standards! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project helps pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and auditors maintain immutable records, reduce fraud, and streamline global compliance processes.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Tamper-proof audit logs stored on-chain  
📊 Real-time compliance reporting and verification  
🌍 Support for international drug standards (e.g., FDA, EMA, WHO guidelines)  
👥 Role-based access for companies, auditors, and regulators  
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanism for compliance challenges  
💰 Incentive system for timely audits and accurate reporting  
🚨 Automated notifications for compliance deadlines and violations  
✅ Instant verification of records without intermediaries  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a secure, decentralized ecosystem. Here's a high-level overview:

- **UserRegistry Contract**: Handles registration and role assignment for users (companies, auditors, regulators).  
- **StandardRegistry Contract**: Stores and updates international drug standards as immutable references.  
- **AuditLog Contract**: Records audit events with timestamps, hashes of documents, and metadata.  
- **ComplianceReport Contract**: Generates and stores compliance reports linked to audits.  
- **Verification Contract**: Allows querying and verifying the authenticity of logs and reports.  
- **AccessControl Contract**: Manages permissions to ensure only authorized parties can view or modify data.  
- **IncentiveToken Contract**: Issues tokens to reward auditors for completed tasks and penalize non-compliance.  
- **DisputeResolution Contract**: Facilitates on-chain disputes with voting or arbitration mechanisms.  

**For Pharmaceutical Companies**  
- Register your entity via the UserRegistry contract.  
- Submit audit data (e.g., hashed manufacturing records) to the AuditLog contract.  
- Generate a compliance report using the ComplianceReport contract, referencing global standards from StandardRegistry.  
- Earn incentives for maintaining compliance through the IncentiveToken contract.  

**For Auditors**  
- Get assigned roles in UserRegistry.  
- Review and log audits in AuditLog, verifying against standards.  
- Use Verification contract to confirm data integrity.  
- Participate in disputes via DisputeResolution and earn tokens for your work.  

**For Regulators**  
- Access tamper-proof records through Verification and AccessControl contracts.  
- Update standards in StandardRegistry (with multi-sig approval).  
- Monitor compliance via automated notifications and reports.  
- Resolve disputes on-chain for transparent enforcement.  

That's it! Deploy these Clarity contracts on Stacks, integrate with a frontend dApp, and you've got a scalable solution to real-world regulatory challenges in the pharma industry.
